/* assets/images - Update Description */

/* Logo (logo.png): */
- Create a new logo that conveys a futuristic quantum-themed design.
- Colors: Use shades of blue and neon to match the quantum aesthetic (e.g., #00ccff, #4285f4).
- Include subtle glowing effects to give a high-tech, sleek look.
- Style: Sharp and modern, potentially with digital or fragmented elements to emphasize the quantum nature.

/* Background (background.gif): */
- Update the background to be a dynamic animation, inspired by the "Matrix"-style cascading binary code, but with a modern twist.
- Animation: Cascading blue numbers (0 and 1) falling from top to bottom, similar to the visual effect described previously.
- Colors: Ensure the blue is vibrant, with different brightness levels to create depth and contrast with the darker background.
- Add a reflective ground surface effect that visually extends the digital space, creating an immersive 3D-like environment.

/* Additional Images: */
- Infographic (timeline-infographic.png): Create a timeline image that visually represents the key message and important dates for Renxim (RXM).
- Design: Use elements like glowing paths, nodes, and digital markers to create an engaging flow, emphasizing the coincidence and quantum nature of the dates.

/* Guidelines: */
- All images should match the overall quantum and futuristic theme.
- Ensure a cohesive look across the website by maintaining consistent color schemes and styles.
